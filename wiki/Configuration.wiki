#summary Description of configuration files used by the game.
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation,Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

Currently there is no visual configuration of the game. However, it is highly modable via number of configuration files. Some of the settings may be changed during runtime via console (``` for entering the console, `?[ENTER]` for displaying commands available for current scene).

Ale the configuration files obey the following conventions:
 * empty lines and lines beginning with '#' character are ignored
 * lines with unrecognised content are ignored
 * main sections start with `[section name]` line
 * if the section name in unrecognised, all following lines till the next session are ignored. This property is often used in the map files - for skipping models `[skip model]` section is used
 * content of the line that follows list of expected parameters is ignored, but for clarity I precede such comments with '#' character
 ex. {{{ Lighting 2 # 0 = none, 1 = basic, 2 = full }}}
 * text parameters are single word by default - you must use quotation marks to enter more words. To insert quotation mark in the text, enter two quotation marks
 ex. {{{ name "Long name with ""quotation marks"" inside" }}}
 * if the property is absent, default value is used

= The game =
The `/Data/config.txt` file configures main options that alter game behaviour. This configuration is divided into two sections - `[graphics]` and `[general]`.

= Keyboard =
The `/Data/keyboard.txt` file defines mapping of keys into their logical functions. First column contains key name, defined in the `/Data/keys.txt` file (only single word names are allowed). Second column contains numerical function code. Mapping of function codes to function names may be found in the `/Source Files/InputCodes.h` file.

= Cameras =
In the `/Data/cameras.txt` file you may configure views during game time. By default window is divided into four viewports - from players side, from top and from their eyes. Int the `/Data/cameras_*.txt` files you may find alternative camera sets.

Configuration file may contain any number of `[camera human]` or `[camera free]` sections. Each section defines one camera of given type (check [Cameras] topic for differences between those types).

= Map list =
In the `/Data/maps.txt` file there is a list of maps shown on the "Select map" screen. It contains number of `[map]` sections. Each section describes one map with following properties:

|| *Property `[values]`* || *Description*                      ||
|| `name [text]`         || name of the map                    ||

|| `img [path]`          || path to the screenshoot of the map ||

= Players list =
Players that may be selected in menu are listed in the `/Data/players.txt` file. It's divided into several `[player]` sections. Each section should define following properties:

|| *Property `[values]`* || *Description*                         ||
|| `name [text]`         || player name                           ||

|| `mass [int]`          || mass of the model                     ||
|| `style [text path]`   || name and path to the file that defines fighting style that may be used by this model (multiple style definitions creates list of available styles) ||

Beside abovementioned options, it is possible to use properties of models defined in the map files. However, most of them makes no sense in current context (ex. disabling physics) or will be overwritten by options selected in the menu.

= Fighting styles =
Exemplary fighting style may be found in the `/Data/models/anim/karate.txt` file. Three types of sections should be included in such file – `[auto]`, `[mirror]` and `[action]`.

== Auto movement ==
This section defines list of actions which may be automatically taken by the fighter in order to move to its destination point:

|| *Property `[values]`*        || *Description*  ||
|| `stop [action]`              || resting action ||
|| `step [action distance 0/1]` || given action will move player by given distance, 0/1 tells if the action may be stopped when destination is reached before finishing ||
|| `back [action distance 0/1]` || given action will move player backward by given distance, 0/1 flag tells if the action may be stopped ||
|| `left [action angle 0/1]`    || given action will rotate player left by given angle (degrees), 0/1 flag tells if the action may be stopped ||
|| `right [action angle 0/1]`   || given action will rotate player right by given angle (degrees), 0/1 flag tells if the action may be stopped ||

== Animation mirroring ==
This section lists bones that form mirroring pairs, ex. left hand with right hand. This data allows using same animation for both sides of the body.
|| *Property `[values]`* || *Description*                                  ||
|| `bones [int int]`     || adds given pair of bones to the mirroring list ||

== Actions and combos ==
Each occurrence of this section defines one action that may be taken by the fighter. It also defines keys that switch between animations (combos). Each time spans are given in miliseconds.
|| *Property `[values]`*             || *Description*                      ||
|| `name [text]`                     || action name                        ||

|| `rotate [0/1]`                    || tells if this action will rotate the fighter (0 by default) ||
|| `mirror [0/1]`                    || tells if this action will mirror the fighter - following animations will be mirrored (0 by default) ||
|| `(combo)`                         || starts subsection that defines possible pass to other action ||
|| `action [action]`                 || destination action                 ||
|| `key [name]`                      || key that activates combo, possible values are: Forward, Backward, *, *Punch, *Kick, *HandGuard, *LegGuard. Where * = Left / Right ||
|| `first [int]`                     || moment of opening the time window during which combo may be activated (0 by default) ||
|| `last [int]`                      || moment of closing the time window during which combo may be activated (0 by default = infinity) ||
|| `time [int]`                      || moment at which target action is started, if `last` is non zero, then `current-first` value is added to this time (0 by default) ||
|| `prec [0/1]`                      || if 1, then no `current-first` value will be added to `time` (0 by default) ||
|| `shift [0/1]`                     || if 1, then player's position matrix will be shifted by the shift of the current root bone position ||
